# Image-Classification-using-Neural-Networks
***
*Classified images bytraining a Convulutional Nueral Network (CNN).
*Managed to receive an accuracy of over 85%
*Used the fashion mnist dataset

#The fashion mnist dataset
*inculdes 60,000 images of the following


# Why the fashion mnist dataset?
1.Its readily available from Keras
2. Mnist is overused in many machine learning projects and classes.
3. Simple to understand.

# Code and Resources used
***
*Python Version: 3.7
*Packages: Numpy,Keras,Matplotlib
*Jupyter Notebook


# Findings
*Used dropout method to reduce overfitting by the model
*Improved knowledge about Convolutional Nueral Networks and deep leanring in general
* Managed to obtain an accuracy close to 90%
