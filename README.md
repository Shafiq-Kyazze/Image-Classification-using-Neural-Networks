# Image-Classification-using-Neural-Networks
***
* Classified images bytraining a Convulutional Nueral Network (CNN).\
* Managed to receive an accuracy of over 85%.\
* Used the fashion mnist dataset.

## The fashion mnist dataset
It includes 60,000 images with the following labels:
|  Label	|    Description    |
--------- |-------------------| 
|0	      |  T-shirt/top      |
|1	      |  Trouser          |
|2	      |  Pullover         |
|3	      |  Dress            |
|4	      |  Coat             |
|5	      |  Sandal           |
|6	      |  Shirt            |
|7	      |  Sneaker          |
|8	      |  Bag              |
|9	      |  Ankle boot       |

# Why the fashion mnist dataset?
1. Its readily available from Keras.\
2. Mnist is overused in many machine learning projects and classes.\
3. Simple to understand.

# Code and Resources used
***
* **Python Version:** 3.7\
* **Packages:** Numpy,Keras,Matplotlib\
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Fashion mnist** : https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist


# Findings
* Used dropout method to reduce overfitting by the model.\
* Improved knowledge about Convolutional Nueral Networks and deep leanring in general.\
* Managed to obtain an accuracy close to 90%.
